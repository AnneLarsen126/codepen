<p id="paragraph"> Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure story set in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification.<br> You play as V, a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality. You can customize your character’s cyberware, skillset and playstyle, and explore a vast city where the choices you make shape the story and the world around you.<br><br> Cyberpunk 2077 entered pre-production when developer CD Projekt Red had finished The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016), with approximately fifty staff members involved. They later devoted a team larger than that of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015), and after it was released, began upgrading their REDengine 3 to complement Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt Red was granted subventions of US$7 million by the Polish government, whose funding application confirmed they were using REDengine 4. In June 2017, preliminary designs were stolen and threatened to be released to the public, but the developer refused to comply. The development reportedly reached a milestone in late 2017, and in March 2018, a new studio opened in Wrocław to aid the production. That October, CD Projekt Red established a partnership with Canadian studio Digital Scapes to craft additional tools for Cyberpunk 2077. The developer partnered with Nvidia in June 2019 to achieve ray tracing in real time, and QLOC in January 2020 for quality assurance. </p>
